## 🧠 About Me

I'm a frontend developer with over **4 years of experience** in web development and a background in full-stack.  
I enjoy crafting sleek user interfaces and diving into decentralized web (Web3) technologies.  
Currently, I'm focused on building products in the blockchain ecosystem — from DEXs to on-chain explorers.  
I'm aiming to grow into a **Senior Frontend Developer**, and eventually explore opportunities in backend development too.
